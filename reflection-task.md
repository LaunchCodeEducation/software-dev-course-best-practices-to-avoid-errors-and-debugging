As you progress through the coding bootcamp, it's essential to think critically about how you approach writing and debugging code. Take some time to reflect on the following questions:


  - How have you applied best practices (like writing clean, modular code or validating inputs)
  to prevent errors in your projects? Can you recall a specific instance where these practices
  saved you from potential issues?

  - Think about a recent debugging experience. What tools or techniques did you use to identify
  and resolve the problem? What did you learn from that process?

  - How has your understanding of the relationship between preventive coding practices and
  debugging evolved during the bootcamp?

  - Looking forward, how can you integrate these lessons into your workflow to write
  more reliable, error-resistant code?


Write a brief response or discuss with your peers to deepen your understanding of these concepts.
